#### Projects

Our project is based on two papers: Chen, Y. and Chu, G. (2014). Estimation of default risk based on kmv model - an empirical study for chinese real estate companies, and Li, L., Yang, J. and Zou, X. (2016). A study of credit risk of chinese listed companies: ZPP versus kmv.

Our main purpose is to use KMV model to estimate the top 14 banks in U.S.A from 2005 to 2021 based on asset size and market capitalization size to see their distance to default in different years.
